> üõ† A tiny log library that allows you to take events, explanations and solutions and connect them like lego-pieces to create user-friendly logs.

Good log messages increases customer satisfaction, as they work as sort of a guide, helping the user achieve what they wanted to achieve. Good logs minimize the amount of support calls, improve customer satisfaction and trust in your product, ultimately being a win-win for both the creators of software and the users.

Inspired by Vercel's [Error design framework](https://vercel.com/design/error#error-design-framework), human-logs allows you to take events, explanations and solutions, and connect them like lego-pieces, to create user-friendly logs in a versatile manner.

**Focus on understanding the errors.**

## Features

- Create consistent, helpful logs that help users fix the problem themselves
- Build versatile errors by connecting events, explanations and solutions
- Support for parameters: template variables into the log messages
- Only 193 lines of code

## üíª Example Usage

We start by defining our `events`, `explanations`, and `solutions`. These will later be used in logs to create user-friendly errors, guiding the users to the right solution.

```typescript
import { createHumanLogs, event, explanation, solution, createTextFormatter } from "human-logs"

export const notionError = createHumanLogs(
  [
    event("fetching_posts_failed", "fetching posts failed", {
      params: {},
    }),
    explanation(
      "missing_params",
      "the {paramType} `{paramName}` is missing for post with ID `{postId}`, and no fallback was provided",
      {
        params: {
          paramType: "",
          paramName: "",
          postId: "",
        },
      }
    ),
    solution(
      "add_missing_param",
      "add the missing {paramType} on your Notion page",
      {
        params: {},
      }
    ),
    solution(
      "provide_fallback",
      "add a fallback to your parameter definition like this:\n\nurl(`{paramName}`, { fallback: `https://useflytrap.com` })",
      {
        params: {
          paramName: "",
        },
      }
    ),
		solution(
      "add_skip_missing_fields",
      "if you want to skip posts that have missing fields, add `skipMissingFields`: true to your `fetchPosts` call like this: `notionSource.fetchPosts({ skipMissingFields: true })`",
      {
        params: {},
      }
    ),
    solution("open_issue", "open an issue for this on GitHub", {
      params: {},
      actions: [
        {
          text: "Open an issue",
          href: "https://github.com/useflytrap/notion-contentlayer/issues/new",
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
  {
    formatter: createTextFormatter({
      eventsPrefix: "üöß ",
      solutionsPrefix: "üõ†Ô∏è ",
    }),
  }
)

// You can now use `notionError` to create user-friendly error logs, by connecting events, explanations and solutions like lego-blocks.
const errorLog = notionError([
  "fetching_posts_failed",
  "missing_params",
  "add_missing_param",
	"provide_fallback",
  "add_skip_missing_fields",
], {
  // üëá these are inferred like magic!
  paramName: 'image',
  paramType: 'Image',
  postId: 'abcd-123',
});

console.log(errorLog.toString())
/* => "üöß Fetching posts failed because the Image `image` is missing for post with ID `abcd-123`, and no fallback was provided.

üõ†Ô∏è Solutions:
1) add the missing Image on your Notion page
2) add a fallback to your parameter definition like this: url(`image`, { fallback: `https://useflytrap.com` })
3) if you want to skip posts that have missing fields, add `skipMissingFields`: true to your `fetchPosts` call like this: `notionSource.fetchPosts({ skipMissingFields: true })`"
*/
```

Wow! Look at how helpful those errors are. These are errors developers, product end-users and everyone in between could only DREAM OF.
